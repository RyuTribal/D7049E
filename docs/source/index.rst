Welcome to Helios's documentation!
===================================

**Helios** is a 3D game engine written in C++ and OpenGL. It was originally
based on the `Hazel 2D engine <https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel>`, 
but has since been heavily modified and expanded.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
